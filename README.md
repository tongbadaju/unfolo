# Unfolo: Find Your Unfollowers Securely

Unfolo is a tool dedicated to answering that age-old question: "Who unfollowed me on Instagram?"

By securely processing the data you download directly from Instagram (no third-party login required!), Unfolo provides a clear, categorized list of:

1. Unfollowers: People you follow who do not follow you back.
2. Fans: People who follow you who you do not follow back.

We prioritize the Unfollowers list to give you immediate insights into your follower consistency.

## Privacy & Security â€” The Unfolo Promise

Traditional unfollower apps require you to enter your Instagram credentials, compromising your security. Unfolo is different.

- No Instagram Login: We never ask for your Instagram password or access tokens.
- Official Data Only: We only process the encrypted ZIP file you download directly from Instagram.
- On-Device Processing: Crucially, your data is processed entirely within your browser or on your local machine. Your follower lists are never uploaded to our servers.

## How It Works (The Core Logic)

The process is simple and relies on comparing the two primary lists from your downloaded data:

1. followers.json: The list of accounts following you.
2. following.json: The list of accounts you are following.

| Category     | Logic                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unfollowers  | Accounts in the following.json list BUT NOT in the followers.json list.  |
| Fans         | Accounts in the followers.json list BUT NOT in the following.json list.  |
